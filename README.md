### Adding API key
Assuming that you already have an API key provided from the Discord Developer Portal, you must add your own APIkey.txt file to host your own version of this bot.

To do so, you must create a file with the name "APIkey.txt" exactly. Afterward, you must go inside that file and create a line that starts with "APIkey: " followed by your own key.

After that, you are done and are able to run the bot from within your own server!
